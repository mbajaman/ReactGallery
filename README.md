### Introduction
This is a native app created by using ```React Native``` and ```Expo XDE```. It can be run on an android phone (by installing the Expo app) or through ```Genymotion``` (setting up a virtual phone).
This is a ```Gallery``` viewer app where users can take pictures using their camera, crop it or select an existing image from their phone. 
It uses Async storage to handle these events and also has a small feature where you can login with your Facebook account and it uploads your profile picture.

### Instructions on running the app
Make sure you ```npm install``` in the project director prior to running the application. You can build and run the app from Expo XDE.
